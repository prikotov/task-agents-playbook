# Business Goals and Strategies

This document defines the business goals of the TasK project and the strategies to achieve them.

---

## Business Goals

### Goal 1: Document Processing Automation

Reduce labor for routine document processing by at least 70% through automatic extraction and structuring of data.

**Success Metrics:**
- Processing time per document: < 1 minute (vs 15-30 minutes manually)
- Data extraction accuracy: > 95%

### Goal 2: Semantic Search across Knowledge Base

Provide search "by meaning" rather than keywords, reducing information search time from hours to seconds.

**Success Metrics:**
- Search time: < 2 seconds
- Relevance of results (search success rate): > 90%

### Goal 3: Data Control

Provide a self-hosted solution in the spirit of digital sovereignty: storage and processing of data on own infrastructure, open standards, and independence from vendor lock-in.

**Success Metrics:**
- Full localization of data on the client's infrastructure
- Compliance with GDPR / internal security policy requirements

## Strategies

### Strategy 1: MVP First

First, a minimum working version for internal users, then iterative functional expansion.

**Principles:**
- Fast feedback from real users
- Minimization of waste (unnecessary functionality)
- Constant hypothesis validation

### Strategy 2: Developer Experience

TasK must be convenient for integration: clean API, documentation, code examples.

**Principles:**
- API-first approach
- Documentation as part of the product
- Self-hosted without vendor lock-in
- Open standards and portable data formats
- Possibility of local processing

### Strategy 3: Quality over Quantity

Better fewer functions working reliably than many with bugs.

**Principles:**
- Stability as a competitive advantage
- Predictable system behavior
- Fast fixing of identified problems
